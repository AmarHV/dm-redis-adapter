h1. DM-Redis

This is an experimental datamapper adapter for the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/README">Redis</a> key-value database.

Please be aware that this is very alpha quality software!  It is not recommended for production use.  Oh, and it will be _slow_ for large sets of data until I'm finished refactoring, which sort of defeats the purpose, wouldn't you say?

h1. Install

Prerequisites
* Redis:
