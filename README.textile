h1. DM-Redis

This is an experimental datamapper adapter for the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/README">Redis</a> key-value database.

Please be aware that this is very alpha quality software!  It is not recommended for production use.

h1. TODO

Currently, the records_for(query) method returns an array of hashes containing the key => id pairs.  Unfortunately, this gets run for every query(and subsequent lazy queries), which means that the more keys you have, the slower it is.  Boo!  I'm in the process of refactoring how this works.  If you have suggestions, please get in touch.

h1. Install

Prerequisites
